# Bandit level 2 -> 3

## Objective  
To read the file in the directory and get the password.

## Commands Used  
ls -> to list files in the directory  
cat -- -> to read the file and stop option parsing  

## Explanation  
The ls command was used to find the file name.
The file name starts with special characters, so cat -- was used to treat it as a normal file and read it.

## Outcomes  
Learned how special characters affect file names in Linux.
